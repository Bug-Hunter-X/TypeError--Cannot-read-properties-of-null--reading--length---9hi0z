# JavaScript Bug: Handling Null and Undefined in Length Checks

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to checking the length of objects that might be null or undefined. The bug occurs when attempting to access the 'length' property of a null or undefined object, resulting in a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')`.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function aims to return the length of the input `x` if `x` is an array or string. However, it does not handle the cases where `x` is `null` or `undefined` or other non-array objects. This leads to an error when attempting to access `x.length` when `x` is not an object that has that property.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves adding a check to handle the cases where `x` is `null` or `undefined`, or when `x` does not have a `length` property.  This is typically done using short-circuiting in JavaScript to check for null or undefined.  We also check for the existence of the `length` property before attempting to access it.

## How to reproduce the error
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `bug.js` (It will throw the error)
3. Observe the error message
4. Run `bugSolution.js` (It will handle the error and return 0 for null or undefined input)
